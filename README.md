# Scenario-Based-Forecast-Study

### A granular study to estimate the demand for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles during 2035 to 2050 for set of 542 global cities. The project has received funding from Clean Sky 2 (CS2) Joint Undertaking (JU) under grant agreement No.864521. The JU receives support from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and the [Clean Sky 2 JU](https://umi2958.gatech.edu/news/oasys-success) members other than the Union.

## Introduction
<p><code>Scenario-Based-Forecast-Study</code> repository contains a group of pythonic subroutines (codes) which are developed to foresact the demand for UAM during 2035 to 2050 timeframe for a set of 542 global cities. Each subroutine performs a special task to execute the scenario outsome.The picture shown below shows the working of each subroutines.</p>
